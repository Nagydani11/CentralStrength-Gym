            <p>With the flexible membership you are not committed to anything and you can cancel your membership at any time. You pay an extra 9.99 euros per 4 weeks for this. Useful if you are not sure whether you want to continue exercising for a year, but not the most economical choice. It is better for both your wallet and your fitness to stay true to your sports plans for at least a year ðŸ˜‰ .</p>
